## Next Steps:
- The seller, Mark, should consider Ed's advice about focusing on either B2B or B2C for his product.
- Mark should also identify companies that would benefit from better research but are currently not investing in it.
- Ed will think about other people who might be interested in discussing Mark's product and will let him know.
## Prospect's Problems:
- Ed mentioned that at Monza, PMs have a more strategic role, which means they spend less time on day-to-day tasks and more time thinking strategically. This could potentially be a problem if they are not able to keep up with the day-to-day operations.
- Ed also mentioned that it's hard to filter out the noise from customer support feedback. This could be a problem if important feedback is missed.
- Ed mentioned that recency bias is a problem when analyzing customer feedback. They try to combat this by working from first principles and written proposals, but it's still a challenge.
- Ed mentioned that the volume of feedback for the home ownership product is manageable, but if it becomes too overwhelming, they might have to switch to a monthly feedback summary or stop looking at it regularly. This could be a problem if important feedback is missed.
## Personal Information:
- Mark and Ed used to work together at Sopa and it's been a couple of years since they last saw each other.
- Mark tried starting his own business and is now back in a fintech company, Moneycast, a startup in the management intelligence space.
- Ed leads a group of squads at Monza covering loans, overdrafts, home ownership, and business borrowing.
