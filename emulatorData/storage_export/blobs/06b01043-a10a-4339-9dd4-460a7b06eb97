I'll just set that to the call.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":228520,"endMs":235320,"text":"Well I guess to start with it'd be good to understand what products you oversee and what","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":235320,"endMs":237260,"text":"your main goals are at the moment at Monza.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":237740,"endMs":249780,"text":"Yeah so I kind of lead a group of squads so we cover loans, overdrafts and home ownership","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":249780,"endMs":251140,"text":"and business borrowing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":251240,"endMs":251800,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":251940,"endMs":256360,"text":"So loans for personal customers, overdrafts for personal

there.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":268540,"endMs":272980,"text":"And then business borrowing is about bringing those loan and overdraft products and other","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":272980,"endMs":280320,"text":"business, other borrowing products to our business customers who have kind of different","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":280320,"endMs":282300,"text":"markets so we're kind of tackling it a bit differently.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":284320,"endMs":291360,"text":"And how, like I guess there are a few things that PMs commonly do so customer interviews,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":291920,"endMs":297540,"text":"data analysis type stuff and also just general management like managing delivery or managing","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":297540,"endMs":298120,"text":"stakeholders.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":298380,"endMs":302940,"text":"Like what's the split in your role in terms of importance and time?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":303880,"endMs":308080,"text":"That's a good question.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":308080,"endMs":318380,"text":"Um, PMs at Monza are a lot more strategic I think in their role because the default","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":318380,"endMs":322140,"text":"infrastructure is to have a really strong engineering manager with you, a really strong","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":322140,"endMs":327040,"text":"designer, a really strong user researcher and a tech lead as well.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":327200,"endMs":327300,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":327300,"endMs":338060,"text":"And a lot of the things that maybe at Zopa I basically would have had to moonlight as a","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":338880,"endMs":343460,"text":"tech side of it really well or do people management like all of that kind of stuff goes","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":343460,"endMs":343980,"text":"out the window.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":345020,"endMs":349700,"text":"So you can think a lot more about your product strategy and so in terms of where I focus","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":349700,"endMs":354680,"text":"my time is it's much more on the product strategy and answering thorny questions of like","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":354680,"endMs":359620,"text":"what should we do next and like where's the highest value place for us to spend our time.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":359700,"endMs":365980,"text":"The second thing that contributes to that is we have quite a strong culture of kind of","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":365980,"endMs":368360,"text":"first principles thinking written down.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":368980,"endMs":376640,"text":"So it's quite common to write like quite a high, like quite a detailed document that","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":376640,"endMs":384860,"text":"thinks really carefully through like a problem space building on research and data and industry","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":384860,"endMs":389320,"text":"and whatever it is, like what's technically possible and about like what we should do.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":390060,"endMs":394620,"text":"So yeah, I probably spend more of my time in that thinking space.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":394620,"endMs":402040,"text":"I spend a lot of time with stakeholders because borrowing is quite stakeholder heavy, like","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":402040,"endMs":404440,"text":"compliance, legal, finance, that kind of stuff.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":405680,"endMs":411660,"text":"And then day to day like really split spending my time with wherever it's needed the most.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":411900,"endMs":417520,"text":"So whether that's with designers if we're working on like a new product and we're like","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":417520,"endMs":420400,"text":"a real design phase at the time and working through those questions.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":421020,"endMs":429820,"text":"Researchers if we're, you know, in the midst of a big research project or more with like","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":429820,"endMs":435300,"text":"engineers or with the roadmap if like we're more in delivery mode.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":435420,"endMs":441040,"text":"So it really varies week to week but versus Zopa definitely a lot more time thinking strategically","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":441040,"endMs":447360,"text":"and a lot less time on day to day delivery or like doing the research or doing the design.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":447540,"endMs":448680,"text":"Yeah, makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":448680,"endMs":452700,"text":"So with the research, do you not do that directly though?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":453360,"endMs":458700,"text":"No, so typically, I mean occasionally I roll up my sleeves and run it but usually","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":458700,"endMs":461320,"text":"we've got dedicated user researchers.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":461880,"endMs":468220,"text":"So I would work with them on what the plan, like what we're trying to work out.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":468580,"endMs":473300,"text":"So let's say we've got a product and we've got like the mortgages product at the moment.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":473540,"endMs":475600,"text":"Let's say we've got like three things we could build next.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":475920,"endMs":481460,"text":"Like I do a lot of the thinking in concert with the designer and tech lead on what are","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":481460,"endMs":482820,"text":"the hypotheses we really need to test.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":483380,"endMs":489220,"text":"Like looking at the data thinking about, okay, people are dropping off at this stage.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":489440,"endMs":490160,"text":"Why would that be?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":491020,"endMs":495660,"text":"Like coming through everything we've got to then say like, okay, our biggest hypotheses","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":495660,"endMs":499320,"text":"that we need to test are like, you know, people don't know how to get through this stage or","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":499320,"endMs":501220,"text":"like they don't understand what it says on this screen.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":501240,"endMs":505500,"text":"Then I'd speak to the researcher and say let's put together a plan for that, kind of work","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":505500,"endMs":505960,"text":"on the plan.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":506200,"endMs":509300,"text":"Then they would really take over and go and recruit participants.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":509580,"endMs":510460,"text":"They would run the calls.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":511000,"endMs":516880,"text":"I would join to take notes on the calls and then they would kind of do a research synthesis.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":517000,"endMs":520760,"text":"So it is a partnership but it's very much led, like the actual research itself is led","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":520760,"endMs":521380,"text":"by the researcher.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":521780,"endMs":527540,"text":"So you mentioned kind of one purpose of using the user researcher, which sounds like it's","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":527540,"endMs":532180,"text":"given there's like a point in the data where you can see there's a problem, understand","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":532180,"endMs":533360,"text":"the why behind it.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":534280,"endMs":538560,"text":"So how important are other reasons for doing user research?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":538820,"endMs":545280,"text":"So like stakeholder management to being able to push back on features or understanding","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":545280,"endMs":550800,"text":"problems about users that aren't related to a specific feature but are just new problems","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":550800,"endMs":551580,"text":"that you might discover.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":552400,"endMs":553660,"text":"How does that break down?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":553760,"endMs":557560,"text":"The first one, I can't really think of an example of us doing that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":557720,"endMs":564200,"text":"I think there's like nothing at Monza is like stakeholder driven in terms of what you","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":564200,"endMs":564400,"text":"build.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":564560,"endMs":566660,"text":"The PM is ultimately responsible for what you build.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":566820,"endMs":569900,"text":"So you'd never have someone say I think we should build this product and you just go","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":569900,"endMs":571600,"text":"do it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":572120,"endMs":575740,"text":"So that's probably not really common.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":576020,"endMs":582800,"text":"But the second one, so kind of more like formative research or foundational research maybe.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":583260,"endMs":583780,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":583320,"endMs":588060,"text":"Yeah, you want to ideally strike a balance of doing that versus tactical research.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":588080,"endMs":588700,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":588700,"endMs":596680,"text":"It tends to happen like two or three times a year around all the technical stuff because","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":596680,"endMs":599820,"text":"there's ultimately always something that you could be researching tactically.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":600080,"endMs":606620,"text":"So you've got to say no to like the part of the journey that you'd really like to research","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":606620,"endMs":611980,"text":"right now and say actually we'll take a pause on that and instead we'll go after this bigger","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":611980,"endMs":620500,"text":"strategic question of like, for example, we had a big insight around our customers","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":620500,"endMs":626740,"text":"who take loans for debt consolidation purposes have very different needs to customers who","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":626740,"endMs":628580,"text":"are taking it to buy a car or buy an asset.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":629480,"endMs":634840,"text":"And so we did a big piece of foundational research around, you know, like 25, 30 interviews","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":634840,"endMs":638180,"text":"of what does that use case look like for them?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":638300,"endMs":641080,"text":"How does it differ for Monza customers versus non-Monza customers?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":641980,"endMs":644860,"text":"Trying to understand and build a journey map out of that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":646260,"endMs":651120,"text":"So I think it's part of the like just the art of PM is trying to, you know, balance","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":651120,"endMs":656520,"text":"enough further ahead strategic thinking because a piece like that could seed like a big project","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":656520,"endMs":657600,"text":"coming down the line.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":657740,"endMs":657880,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":657880,"endMs":661400,"text":"And you've got to balance that with like what you're doing in the here and now.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":661460,"endMs":666040,"text":"You don't want to do too much of the blue sky thinking and not be able to build what's","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":666040,"endMs":666520,"text":"in front of you.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":666720,"endMs":670680,"text":"You don't want to only focus on this product because as soon as you have something that's","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":670680,"endMs":672920,"text":"good in market, you're like, OK, what's next?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":673320,"endMs":673680,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":673820,"endMs":676480,"text":"So it's always a balance and you're always trying to get it right.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":676880,"endMs":677820,"text":"Yeah, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":678840,"endMs":682960,"text":"And then aside from user interviews, which I think you mentioned, what other types of","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":682960,"endMs":685660,"text":"research do the user researchers do?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":685800,"endMs":694200,"text":"They can do anything, really, but more on the qual side.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":695420,"endMs":697100,"text":"So we do surveys.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":698340,"endMs":702340,"text":"We don't rely on surveys too much, but yeah, occasional surveys.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":703680,"endMs":708440,"text":"One really interesting one we did in the past was social listening, which was basically","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":708440,"endMs":714000,"text":"going into like forums and Facebook groups and things like that and understanding how","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":714000,"endMs":718620,"text":"people talk about like a money problem in their own words, which is really, really useful","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":718620,"endMs":720140,"text":"for understanding attitudes.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":723280,"endMs":728020,"text":"Usability testing, I would probably disaggregate from user interviews.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":728660,"endMs":728660,"text":"","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":729460,"endMs":734380,"text":"And usability testing is probably the place that we're most likely to kind of self-serve","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":734380,"endMs":734840,"text":"research.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":735200,"endMs":741400,"text":"So as much as we have some great researchers, we have more questions than capacity always.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":742200,"endMs":748120,"text":"So like today, we've been doing some self-serve research where the researcher helps us get","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":748120,"endMs":751440,"text":"set up and do the recruitment and so on.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":751540,"endMs":754360,"text":"And we've got much better logistics in place now for that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":754440,"endMs":761020,"text":"But, you know, people in the team, our designer, for example, or me or one of the other PMs","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":761020,"endMs":768260,"text":"can kind of hop in and do that usability test themselves because it's ultimately like a","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":768260,"endMs":769500,"text":"fairly straightforward piece of research.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":769740,"endMs":770380,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":770380,"endMs":773380,"text":"And you mentioned right at the start of that social listening.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":773580,"endMs":774180,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":774600,"endMs":780680,"text":"Would that be monitoring Monzo's social media engagement or is that more?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":781680,"endMs":782000,"text":"No.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":782060,"endMs":784200,"text":"So the example, I've only got one example of that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":784520,"endMs":784520,"text":"","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":784580,"endMs":790160,"text":"I haven't done loads of it, but no, it was we used like Mumsnet, Money Saving Expert,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":791000,"endMs":797720,"text":"like big, wide open Facebook groups, not like private Facebook, like big groups that people","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":797720,"endMs":799800,"text":"kind of post money stuff on or whatever.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":800800,"endMs":805700,"text":"And it was kind of keyword search to find relevant topics and then just reading through","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":805700,"endMs":810320,"text":"and thinking, OK, what common mental models do we see in here when people talk about their","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":810320,"endMs":810580,"text":"debts?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":810680,"endMs":816040,"text":"Like why would they consider a debt consolidation loan versus a balance transfer and like seeing","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":816040,"endMs":817760,"text":"what people recommend each other?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":818120,"endMs":823020,"text":"And so like the idea of social listening was literally like being a fly on the wall as","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":823020,"endMs":827220,"text":"people of different like social platforms to see what people were saying.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":827660,"endMs":828880,"text":"How useful did you find it?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":830000,"endMs":832160,"text":"Super useful for understanding mental models.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":834320,"endMs":840540,"text":"We, you know, as soon as you get someone on a call, they're in a kind of test environment,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":840600,"endMs":845220,"text":"whereas if you see people giving advice to each other on a forum, that's kind of how","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":845220,"endMs":848380,"text":"they speak and the words they use is very important.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":849320,"endMs":855000,"text":"Like and you can also kind of get a sense of sentiment like to people generally, you","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":855000,"endMs":858600,"text":"know, that consolidation was the example to people generally bring that up and say, no,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":858600,"endMs":859460,"text":"that's a terrible thing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":859460,"endMs":861440,"text":"I had a really bad experience with that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":861660,"endMs":864200,"text":"Would they generally positively dispose to it or is it a mix?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":864480,"endMs":866180,"text":"Like this kind of stuff is really useful for them.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":866700,"endMs":868100,"text":"How would you frame a product?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":869980,"endMs":871620,"text":"How would you even describe it?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":871700,"endMs":874260,"text":"Like do people understand what the words mean?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":874520,"endMs":878200,"text":"Like what are the use cases that they're positive about?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":878340,"endMs":879480,"text":"What are the use cases they're negative about?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":880160,"endMs":881380,"text":"OK, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":881500,"endMs":883260,"text":"And would you, was it a lot of work?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":883340,"endMs":883940,"text":"Would you do it again?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":885120,"endMs":888100,"text":"I think it was quite a lot of work.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":888100,"endMs":894440,"text":"It was, yeah, one of our senior user researchers ran it kind of in the quiet period over Christmas","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":894440,"endMs":899080,"text":"where he didn't rely on recruiting anyone because it's hard to get people on interviews","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":899080,"endMs":899740,"text":"around that time.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":900580,"endMs":909140,"text":"But yeah, I think, yeah, what we, it is definitely quite an uncommon one to do that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":909940,"endMs":916480,"text":"Most of what we do would be either concept testing or usability testing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":916480,"endMs":921260,"text":"In both cases, you've got designs, but the questions you're asking are a bit different.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":922220,"endMs":925120,"text":"Or like foundational interviews.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":926600,"endMs":929920,"text":"And then, yeah, that's probably most of it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":930120,"endMs":932660,"text":"I'll have a quick look at our research insights channel and see.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":933440,"endMs":936320,"text":"Yeah, so just looking.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":937220,"endMs":944660,"text":"That was, we spoke to, so that's deep dive interviews, deep dive interviews, deep dive","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":946960,"endMs":947620,"text":"surveys.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":947700,"endMs":948760,"text":"Deep dive interviews.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":949080,"endMs":951060,"text":"Yeah, I'd say it's mostly deep dive interviews.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":951700,"endMs":951880,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":952040,"endMs":952820,"text":"OK.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":953640,"endMs":957960,"text":"Have you ever talked to customer support or customer service at all?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":958840,"endMs":966720,"text":"We have various, or we have various ways of getting feedback in from customer support, but","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":966720,"endMs":971580,"text":"it's not, I don't have a regular forum with them.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":972060,"endMs":979640,"text":"And part of the reason for that is, well, yeah, so we've got a weekly, we've got a monthly","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":979640,"endMs":983400,"text":"forum where complaints would be discussed.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":983680,"endMs":987140,"text":"So you can get a sense of what theme's coming up there.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":987260,"endMs":995480,"text":"We have various Slack channels where specific feedback would get surfaced, and especially","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":995480,"endMs":996260,"text":"around bugs.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":997560,"endMs":1005920,"text":"But generally, we're at the scale where it's very hard to filter out the kind of signal","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1005920,"endMs":1006940,"text":"from the noise, I think.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1007160,"endMs":1015120,"text":"And so it would be more like I would go and ask a question rather than like, here's what","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1015120,"endMs":1018540,"text":"we're hearing from customers, because it tends to be pretty consistent.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1020460,"endMs":1025060,"text":"Like, you know, we get hundreds of thousands of customers contacting us a month.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1025260,"endMs":1025400.0000000001,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1029060,"endMs":1032180.0000000001,"text":"So, yeah, I mean, it really depends what question you want to ask, right?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1032180.0000000001,"endMs":1036280,"text":"Like, there's definitely more insight out there than there is time to analyze the insight.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1036700,"endMs":1036859.9999999999,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1036859.9999999999,"endMs":1042940,"text":"So, like, I would really consider the maturity of the products I have when I think about","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1042940,"endMs":1045660.0000000001,"text":"what kind of source of insight I want to look at.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1045680.0000000001,"endMs":1049520,"text":"So like, our Overdraft product is extremely mature, like very well penetrated.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1050040,"endMs":1050200,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1050200,"endMs":1051360,"text":"And it's very stable.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1051460,"endMs":1053720,"text":"We haven't changed the product for 12 months.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1054060,"endMs":1054360,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1055380,"endMs":1057020,"text":"So I wouldn't be listening.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1057600,"endMs":1062780,"text":"Like, I'd keep an eye out for like new complaints coming in that might indicate that something's","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1062780,"endMs":1064280,"text":"shifted or broken.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1064840,"endMs":1069680,"text":"But generally, I wouldn't be, if my strategy is not around developing that product more,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1069760,"endMs":1074260,"text":"like I'm not particularly like spending loads of time going out to search for new insight.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1074900,"endMs":1078060,"text":"On the flip side, something like our Home Ownership Proposition, which is brand new,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1078540,"endMs":1084260,"text":"we've got like in-app feedback forms that we put in so that they can pipe directly to","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1084260,"endMs":1086240,"text":"the team and they pop up in Slack.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1086380,"endMs":1092320,"text":"So you get a dozen notifications a day with people saying, here's my idea, here's the","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1092320,"endMs":1093620,"text":"thing that isn't working for me, whatever.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1093940,"endMs":1098800,"text":"You've got a super fast feedback mechanism there because it's brand new and you want","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1098800,"endMs":1102200,"text":"to like iterate really quickly in response.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1102940,"endMs":1107020,"text":"And then Loan sits kind of in the middle of that where it's like quite an established","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1107020,"endMs":1110560,"text":"product, like we're not reinventing the wheel necessarily.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1110980,"endMs":1111580,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1111580,"endMs":1115160,"text":"We don't need that kind of like, you know, does this even work for people?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1115620,"endMs":1115620,"text":"","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1115620,"endMs":1121940,"text":"But we kind of want to go to our customers on a more regular basis, then they've got","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1121940,"endMs":1126400,"text":"to understand what's working for them, like what are the areas that we could still improve?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1126980,"endMs":1131500,"text":"And yeah, and then for each of those different types of products, you'd probably use different","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1131500,"endMs":1131920,"text":"approaches.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1132360,"endMs":1133820,"text":"Yeah, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1134060,"endMs":1138200,"text":"And is it easy to keep on top of all of that stuff?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1138260,"endMs":1140520,"text":"So all of the like customer comments coming in?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1143000,"endMs":1148160,"text":"Well, as I say, I don't really like we don't.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1148160,"endMs":1154960,"text":"So the feedback channel for the home ownership stuff is at the scale where it's a manageable","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1154960,"endMs":1157180,"text":"volume of comments that come in.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1157200,"endMs":1162680,"text":"Once it gets to the point that you're getting, you know, hundreds a day, like you probably","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1162680,"endMs":1168380,"text":"turn it off Slack and you move to like more of a monthly feedback summary or something,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1168380,"endMs":1172320,"text":"or maybe decide that actually, we're not hearing anything new through this that we","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1172320,"endMs":1173020,"text":"don't already know.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1173480,"endMs":1178320,"text":"And so you stop looking at it regularly until you get to an inflection point, or you get","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1178320,"endMs":1181240,"text":"to a natural point where you just shipped a new feature and you're thinking, what, where","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1181240,"endMs":1181920,"text":"do we go next?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1182200,"endMs":1182640,"text":"You go back.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1183500,"endMs":1193340,"text":"So like, to an extent, there's also like an art as a PM, I think of when are you in like","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1193340,"endMs":1196840,"text":"discovery and strategy mode versus when you're in execution mode?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1197120,"endMs":1197320,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1197600,"endMs":1201700,"text":"Like if you're listening, if you're looking at that insight too closely every single day,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1201700,"endMs":1206320,"text":"like you potentially just become really indecisive and you're like, well, should we build that","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1206320,"endMs":1207080,"text":"or should we build that?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1207080,"endMs":1208880,"text":"Because we're hearing this thing, we're hearing that thing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1208920,"endMs":1213480,"text":"So I think you've got to be strategic about when is the time to spend a lot of time on","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1213480,"endMs":1214000,"text":"your insight.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1214000,"endMs":1218200,"text":"I can go really deep on it, which is why I think it works a lot better as like, here's","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1218200,"endMs":1222900,"text":"a question I want to ask and how can I answer it rather than, you know, what do people want","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1222900,"endMs":1223640,"text":"to tell me?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1223780,"endMs":1225100,"text":"Yeah, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1225660,"endMs":1232240,"text":"And on that point, is recency bias something you've experienced or like when you have,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1232740,"endMs":1237600,"text":"you've done, say, three interviews in the past week and then maybe they've said similar","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1237600,"endMs":1242580,"text":"things, but then over the course of the 30 that you've done in the most recent round,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1242580,"endMs":1244180,"text":"it might not be significant.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1244560,"endMs":1246240,"text":"Yeah, definitely.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1246780,"endMs":1247280,"text":"Definitely.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1247280,"endMs":1251140,"text":"I think it's like human nature to, I mean, it literally is human nature.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1253920,"endMs":1259320,"text":"I think because as I say, we usually work from first principles and with written proposals,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1259460,"endMs":1262020,"text":"that kind of helps to combat it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1262020,"endMs":1265600,"text":"Because if you start writing a proposal and you say, you know, we're building this new","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1265600,"endMs":1269460,"text":"feature because we've heard customers say this thing and then you think, well, okay,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1269460,"endMs":1271120,"text":"how many customers have I heard say this?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1271320,"endMs":1272060,"text":"Oh, it was three people.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1272560,"endMs":1277000,"text":"You're going to go back and say, actually, do we have enough evidence to support this?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1277080,"endMs":1284420,"text":"Like having to write it down, I think forces you to interrogate, like, am I using my gut","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1284420,"endMs":1285020,"text":"judgment here?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1285220,"endMs":1291060,"text":"And then having kind of forums where you get challenged on that, like product review, where","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1291060,"endMs":1293840,"text":"you go, we're thinking of building this next because we've heard this.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1294200,"endMs":1300460,"text":"Like you've got a load of other decision makers in the room to say, well, yeah, you might","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1300460,"endMs":1304780,"text":"have heard that from a couple of people, but is that representative or like, I don't think","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1304780,"endMs":1306020,"text":"you've proven that customer need.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1306620,"endMs":1308920,"text":"Like beyond any doubt at this point.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1310040,"endMs":1310600,"text":"So, yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1310660,"endMs":1313440,"text":"Yes, recency bias 100% exists.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1314220,"endMs":1315560,"text":"Hopefully we've got ways to combat it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1315860,"endMs":1318380,"text":"But yeah, we're all fallible humans.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1318800,"endMs":1323020,"text":"How do you go about, so when you're in that room with those stakeholders, how do you go","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1323020,"endMs":1328360,"text":"about proving beyond a reasonable doubt that some like some insight is valuable when it's","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1328360,"endMs":1329400,"text":"all qualitative data?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1332740,"endMs":1336520,"text":"I guess you wouldn't, I wouldn't rely entirely on qualitative data.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1336860,"endMs":1337200,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1337240,"endMs":1345120,"text":"So for example, we launched the first version of the mortgage visibility feature and we","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1345120,"endMs":1347880,"text":"got a whole load of different things and people like, I love this.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1347960,"endMs":1351340,"text":"I want to be able to like see the history of my mortgage.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1351400,"endMs":1353280,"text":"I want to be able to make extra payments on my mortgage.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1353300,"endMs":1357340,"text":"But one of the themes was the numbers aren't quite right.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1359940,"endMs":1364000,"text":"And you could like, we got enough of that feedback to quantitatively say, okay, like,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1364320,"endMs":1368560,"text":"you know, it's about 30% saying the numbers aren't right and 30% saying overpayments.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1368780,"endMs":1369200,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1369200,"endMs":1373920,"text":"But then you apply some kind of judgment on top of that, which is okay, overpayments","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1373920,"endMs":1376720,"text":"are nice to have, like it would be really cool to have that on the app.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1376800,"endMs":1379460,"text":"But if the numbers aren't right, that's a trust breaking moment.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1379840,"endMs":1385060,"text":"And yeah, and then the discussion you have in the room is, yeah, we don't have, you know,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1385060,"endMs":1387080,"text":"a million bits of data here.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1387140,"endMs":1391060,"text":"But from first principles, it's important that a product is trustworthy from day one.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1391760,"endMs":1394960,"text":"It's more about the narrative that you're thinking through.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1394980,"endMs":1397820,"text":"Like it's not just like, here's a data point and therefore we should do this.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1397880,"endMs":1403380,"text":"It's like, here's a data point and our intuition and experience and the principles we use to","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1403380,"endMs":1405280,"text":"build products tell us that based on this.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1405700,"endMs":1406800,"text":"Yeah, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1407880,"endMs":1408720,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1409300,"endMs":1409900,"text":"Right.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1410360,"endMs":1416500,"text":"And then with the user researchers, where, I guess when you're doing research, there's","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1416500,"endMs":1420820,"text":"a sourcing stage, like actual execution to actually doing it and the synthesis stage.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1421740,"endMs":1424340,"text":"What parts do the user researchers handle?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1424660,"endMs":1426500,"text":"What parts do you pick up?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1427560,"endMs":1430120,"text":"They basically do all of it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1430300,"endMs":1434880,"text":"We have a research ops team that help them with some of the recruiting and like building","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1434880,"endMs":1437520,"text":"better infrastructure for going out and doing recruiting.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1437880,"endMs":1442040,"text":"But really as a PM, you'd be working with your user researcher at the start and the","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1442040,"endMs":1442340,"text":"end.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1442600,"endMs":1446540,"text":"The what do we want to research and what are we trying to find out and making sure you","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1446540,"endMs":1447320,"text":"set it up right.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1447540,"endMs":1449760,"text":"So our user researchers are really good.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1449940,"endMs":1452220,"text":"So they're really good at working this out themselves.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1452360,"endMs":1452820,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1453060,"endMs":1458400,"text":"If you like really specific about this is exactly like I'm trying to pick between these","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1458400,"endMs":1459720,"text":"two things that we could do.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1459720,"endMs":1466760,"text":"Let's make sure that we set up our research script or whatever in such a way that we can","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1466760,"endMs":1467720,"text":"distinguish between those.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1468980,"endMs":1471000,"text":"Or like there's a specific nuance I'm trying to get out.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1471100,"endMs":1473500,"text":"Let's make sure that the research plan covers that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1474980,"endMs":1479560,"text":"Or like, you know, we have a good hypothesis here that our customers

usually a notion.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1565740,"endMs":1568160,"text":"So we use notion as our, kind of, on a wiki.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1568300,"endMs":1570460,"text":"It's usually a write up of that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1571880,"endMs":1573700,"text":"It is a report, basically.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1575060,"endMs":1580000,"text":"Sometimes it's supplemented

Z.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1593620,"endMs":1595880,"text":"Here are the big insights that came out of it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1596200,"endMs":1600160,"text":"You know, one or two people said this, but we didn't hear it again.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1600460,"endMs":1601920,"text":"So that wasn't very comprehensive.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1602360,"endMs":1606720,"text":"Everyone we spoke to, you know, had trouble finding their mortgage account

sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1620520,"endMs":1623580,"text":"And so you're filtering out, if I've understood it correctly,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1623580,"endMs":1625860,"text":"you filter out all the stuff that's one or two people,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1625860,"endMs":1627860,"text":"or is not quantitatively significant.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1627960,"endMs":1631520,"text":"And then you just have themes that you picked out as important.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1632380,"endMs":1634960,"text":"Yeah, I wouldn't say like filtered out.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1635020,"endMs":1638520,"text":"It's more like, as you go through those findings, it's like,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1640320,"endMs":1642780,"text":"it's not a finding if one person said it.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1642860,"endMs":1643500,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1643500,"endMs":1646100,"text":"You might say, we heard a couple of people say this

still out a bit more.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1651600,"endMs":1654880,"text":"It's more that the findings are going to be qualified by like how certain you are about them.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1654920,"endMs":1658440,"text":"And do you know if you use any tools for user insight?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1660600,"endMs":1664340,"text":"For like what specifically?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1665080,"endMs":1668460,"text":"Well, maybe it's a good time to just introduce what I'm thinking of doing.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1668680,"endMs":1672680,"text":"So basically, the problem I've seen, especially maybe in B2B companies,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1674120,"endMs":1679540,"text":"is product managers, like customer facing people like salespeople,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1679720,"endMs":1684020,"text":"or customer success, or customer service often understand the customers really well.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1684660,"endMs":1688760,"text":"But there's a high volume of insight coming from those people.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1689040,"endMs":1692200,"text":"So loads of sales calls or loads of customer service tickets.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1692560,"endMs":1697060,"text":"So just building a bridge or a shared repository between like those three teams,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1697100,"endMs":1699640,"text":"where products doing some really great user interviews,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1700360,"endMs":1702400,"text":"sales calls kind of highlight key problems.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1703040,"endMs":1707340,"text":"And also customer service, like have some really good operational insights.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1707580,"endMs":1711880,"text":"And just putting that in a shared repository is one benefit.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1711980,"endMs":1716240,"text":"And the second benefit is time, where to do all of this synthesis, it takes,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1717300,"endMs":1720080,"text":"well, for me, it takes a really long time for each interview.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1720360,"endMs":1724480,"text":"And especially if you want themes that are kind of quantified by how often","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1724480,"endMs":1726860,"text":"people have said things, it can be really difficult.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1727060,"endMs":1729820,"text":"The idea is there is just automatic transcription,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1729820,"endMs":1734000,"text":"and then AI kind of synthesis or topic clustering.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1735660,"endMs":1736100,"text":"That makes sense.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1737680,"endMs":1741240,"text":"Yeah, I think obviously, we've got the luxury of having","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1741240,"endMs":1743680,"text":"kind of full time researchers on that.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1744360,"endMs":1747820,"text":"When you don't have a full time researcher,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1748100,"endMs":1750500,"text":"and that becomes a lot more painful, like you're trading off a lot more,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1751300,"endMs":1753280,"text":"like, I don't have time to do any research at all.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1753340,"endMs":1756240,"text":"And so it gets you from zero to some research.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1756840,"endMs":1759780,"text":"So it feels most useful to me in that kind of space,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1760160,"endMs":1763880,"text":"where probably Zopa would be a good example where you don't,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1763900,"endMs":1767580,"text":"you don't for whatever reason, like have a culture of having full time researchers.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1767720,"endMs":1774100,"text":"I think Monzo has, Monzo is a little bit different in that it's always been incredible.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1774260,"endMs":1778120,"text":"Like I know every company says it's customer driven, but","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1778120,"endMs":1783100,"text":"every product at Monzo has started from like research, basically,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1783200,"endMs":1785340,"text":"like no product really gets built without research happening.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1785340,"endMs":1787540,"text":"Whereas at Zopa, it was more like the exception than the rule.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1787980,"endMs":1790320,"text":"Like, yeah, we did some research before we built this thing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1790800,"endMs":1792880,"text":"But yeah, at the time, we didn't bother.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1793560,"endMs":1798620,"text":"So, so culturally, Monzo has always bought into the value of research","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1798620,"endMs":1801220,"text":"and has always invested in it as well in terms of,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1801580,"endMs":1804680,"text":"like, the ideal is that you should have a researcher per squad.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1805060,"endMs":1808160,"text":"But at most you have a researcher per two or three squads.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1808560,"endMs":1812200,"text":"And they are some of the busiest people in the company.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1812200,"endMs":1812620,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1813220,"endMs":1817900,"text":"So in that kind of place, it feels like a much higher bar that you'd have to","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1817900,"endMs":1821460,"text":"clear in order to deliver differentiated value.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1821920,"endMs":1822320,"text":"Yeah, I agree.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1822840,"endMs":1826860,"text":"I mean, it's not currently benefiting from user insight or research.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1827200,"endMs":1831580,"text":"On a regular basis, it feels like a definitely useful tool.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1831920,"endMs":1832740,"text":"Yeah, I completely agree.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1832780,"endMs":1834780,"text":"It seems like you're really well set up.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1834780,"endMs":1839380,"text":"If you've got like a specialized team for it, you don't really have the,","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1839880,"endMs":1842640,"text":"the problem that you're time poor from doing loads of research.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1843100,"endMs":1844700,"text":"So that definitely makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1845720,"endMs":1848340,"text":"Yeah. So I guess for you, it's like, how can you identify","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1848340,"endMs":1852660,"text":"the companies that would most benefit from better research","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1852660,"endMs":1854620,"text":"and are least investing in it at the moment?","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1855120,"endMs":1856860,"text":"Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1857440,"endMs":1860820,"text":"Do you have any other advice for me?","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1860840,"endMs":1862580,"text":"Um.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1862580,"endMs":1866780,"text":"Yeah, I mean, I think you're coming about it in the right way.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1868480,"endMs":1869260,"text":"Not really.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1869440,"endMs":1872220,"text":"I guess like it does sound like you're blurring B2B and B2C.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1872520,"endMs":1875040,"text":"And like, you probably want to pick one of them to start with.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1875240,"endMs":1878800,"text":"This, yeah, that's one of the decisions I need to make like quite quickly","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1878800,"endMs":1879980,"text":"because they are very different.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1880860,"endMs":1882860,"text":"And the problem you're solving is quite different.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1882900,"endMs":1884940,"text":"Like B2C is volume of customer data.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1885300,"endMs":1885820,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1885820,"endMs":1887040,"text":"You're synthesizing.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1887580,"endMs":1889800,"text":"Whereas B2B, the volume is probably lower, but the quality","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1889800,"endMs":1892420,"text":"and depth of it is probably higher.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1892480,"endMs":1893700,"text":"If you're having sales calls,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1893940,"endMs":1898940,"text":"you get a lot fewer data points, but a lot more, a lot richer data points.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1899440,"endMs":1899620,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1899620,"endMs":1902840,"text":"So the solution you want is probably going to look quite different between them.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1902900,"endMs":1907340,"text":"Yeah, I've definitely done a few calls and B2B seems a bit more receptive to it","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1907340,"endMs":1908560,"text":"than B2C, which is interesting.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1908800,"endMs":1910340,"text":"It kind of makes sense.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1910540,"endMs":1914300,"text":"I've got a friend who's actually had this kind of had this problem.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1914520,"endMs":1916620,"text":"He's between jobs at the moment,","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1916620,"endMs":1920320,"text":"but he was in a small company and really struggling to get.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1920820,"endMs":1922580,"text":"Actually, no, that's I tell a lie.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1922580,"endMs":1925960,"text":"His problem was that they didn't have enough clients to generate customer insight","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1925960,"endMs":1930340,"text":"because you can only do a sales call so many times with the same five clients.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1930620,"endMs":1930900,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1931260,"endMs":1933180,"text":"So, yeah, maybe that's less relevant.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1933720,"endMs":1937260,"text":"I've just noticed the time I do need to jump onto my 4.30.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1937860,"endMs":1938440,"text":"Yeah, sure.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1939500,"endMs":1940780,"text":"But it was great to catch up.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1941240,"endMs":1942180,"text":"It was great catching up.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1942360,"endMs":1945720,"text":"And let me know if there's anyone else that you think would be interested in talking about this.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1945720,"endMs":1948560,"text":"I know you mentioned that friend, but just anyone else you can think of.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1948880,"endMs":1949720,"text":"Yeah, I'll have a think.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1949780,"endMs":1952140,"text":"I reckon he could be worth a chat.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1953140,"endMs":1956400,"text":"Let me have a think because he is very busy applying for other jobs.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1957480,"endMs":1957680,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1957720,"endMs":1959360,"text":"Cool.","speakerIndex":1},{"startMs":1960300,"endMs":1960580,"text":"Yeah.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1961100,"endMs":1962300,"text":"Well, I'll let you get on with that call.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1962520,"endMs":1963780,"text":"But great to talk to you.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1964360,"endMs":1964560,"text":"Awesome.","speakerIndex":0},{"startMs":1964820,"endMs":1965520,"text":"Yeah.
